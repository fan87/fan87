# fan87's manual
Note: This is not finished yet, and my GitHub profile is still a mess (Like there are tons of repositories that should be public but they are still private.)

fan87 is a backend developer, who considers himself as a junior backend developer. 

### Experiences

Most of them are private. I don't like to let all of my friends know what I've been working on.

- Minecraft Client Development
  - Owner of RektSky

Ya, that's all lmao. Most of them are not here tho since this readme is gonna be public.
