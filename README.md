## IDE/Editors Used

They are not sorted.

#### VS Code

I always use this IDE for some website and Node.js, Typescript, dart projects. The performance is pretty great until the project gets larger and larger.<br>
I don't use this as a text editor, but for json editing and code editing.

#### Vim

I'm not that good at this, and still learning it. Sometimes I use vim, vscode, nano or gedit lol.

#### IntelliJ IDEA

I use this IDE for Java. Well, I tried to code Java with VSCode and Eclipse before, VSCode dies, and it wasn't a good experience. Eclipse is great, but you can code a lot faster in Intellij IDEA is just way better.

#### Pycharm

I use this IDE for large python project. Sometimes I use VS Code for python projects but it doesn't matter, it's just if I want to use it or not.

#### Nano

I use this when I feel free to.

#### Gedit

I use this when I feel free to.

## Languages Learned

Sorted by use rate:

#### Java

Well, I would say this language is outdated, but it's still worth learning. You can start the jounery with Java (specially if you play Minecraft), and then learn more advanced languages.<br>

##### Pros

- Pretty easy to find the method you want to use, and you don't really need to read the API document to learn a new API.
- Fast enough, not fastest tho.
- Pretty old, so there are tons of Java API out there you can use.
- Cross-platform
- Garbage Collector
- Existance of gradle/maven
- Class Loader, Java Agent(class transforming), Reflection, Bytecode(and it's pretty easy to understand.), Method/Field/Class name are still there (And you can remove them by obfuscating your java program) and tons of other "hacky" features like this
- Full Object Oriented, so the auto complete is pretty nice and sweet.

##### Cons

- `async`/`await` is not a thing. I mean `Thread` exists, but still.
- It's hard to run or compile a java program for beginner (Tips: You can use maven instead of `javac` everytime, which makes your life 10000 times easier)

#### Python

A scripting language. I won't actually use it in large projects. But you can still use it as a programming language.

##### Pros

- If you want to make a script that does some advanced stuff, python is the best language for this.
- `pip`(the packagke manager of Python) is very easy to use and understand, unlike maven(for java) and `npm`(for node.js)
- Same as Java, there are tons of API out there for you to use, actually, more than java.
- Very very very very very easy to understand, that's why people always start with python.
- Easy to understand its asyncio system

##### Cons

- Too slow.
- Type hint is not forced, so many people are still making API without type hints. It makes auto complete nearly impossible.
- Understandable but bad `import` mechanic for larger projects, it always causes some circular import problems in larger projects if you are doing type hints, and you'll get crazy by time.

##### Pro tip

Do you know that people who tell you that they are "very good at python" are usually bad at coding? A normal person who knows what is programming about won't say they are good at some particular languages, specially Python.
