(Should I get a server that auto-crafts the banner by my GitHub stats in real-time lol, that would be fun to do)

Note: This is not finished yet, and my GitHub profile is still a mess (Like there are tons of repositories that should be public but they are still private.)

fan87 is mostly doing Minecraft modding work, some backend work, and a lot of JVM software/program reversing work.

( Right now I'm bored so let's finish this manual lol )

### Projects

Most of them are private. I don't like to let all of my friends know what I've been working on.

Also they are not all, there are too many and I'm lazy to add them all.

  - JVM Behavior (80%)
  - And other stuff like serialization reflection blablabla (99%)
- ASM (30%) (Still learning, and about to start hard learning it)
- Python (75%) (Let's face the truth, it's a scripting language.)
- Markdown (70%) (Fluently)
- Vanilla Javascript (40%) (Still learning)
